Various small projects using different api data and ruby-processing for visuals

#getting setup
1. I haven't got it working in a non-jruby environment, so I prefer to use just rvm and install jruby
   rvm install jruby
2. rvm jruby (to switch to jruby)
3. gem install ruby-processing
4. gem install twitter (twitter api)


#twitter-visuals
  -- viewer.rb [visualize image profiles for latest tweet for a certain term)
  To run: rp5 run viewer.rb --jruby
  Currently its pretty generic, just shows image profiles for latest tweets for certain term
  Mouse clicks: 
    - When mouse is pressed, api is hit continuously and new image profiles are rendered randomly around the click area
    - When mouse is released, the continuous rendering is stopped. 
    - When mouse is pressed and moved around, images are rendered randomnly around that path.

  -- network_viewer [visualize image profiles for friends/followers for a particular user]
  To run: rp5 run network_viewer.rb --jruby



#TODO: (lots)
  viewer
  - embed link url to actual tweet
  - display the tweet
  - better randomization of images
  - use OAuth instead of HTTP auth

  network_viewer
  - explore linking profile images
  - add more weight(size) to profiles with highest followers?? rank??
  - explore adding links to profile images that redoes visualization for that profile
